# Advent of Code 2024 🎄🚀

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! Here, I challenge myself to solve all the puzzles using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), my favorite language for safe and performant programming. 🦀

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that delivers daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. It’s a fun way to sharpen your problem-solving skills while exploring creative solutions in your language of choice.

## Why Rust?

Rust is an excellent choice for:

- **Performance**: Ideal for complex algorithms and large-scale computations.
- **Safety**: Guarantees memory safety with zero-cost abstractions.
- **Challenge**: Let’s be honest, wrestling with the borrow checker is part of the fun. 😅

## My Goals

1. Solve each day's puzzle using idiomatic and efficient Rust code.
2. Improve my understanding of advanced Rust features (lifetimes, iterators, etc.).
3. Share my progress and learn from the community!

## Structure

Each day's solution can be found in its respective file in the `src/bin` directory:

📂 src/bin/
|
├── day01.rs
|
├── day02.rs
|
├── day03.rs
└── ...

Run a specific solution using:

```bash
cargo run --bin day<number>
```

## Follow My Progress

You can follow my daily updates here: Advent of Code Profile
Or check out my solutions directly in this repository. Feedback and discussions are always welcome!

## ⭐️ Good luck to everyone participating in AOC 2024!

May your code be clean and your solutions performant. 🚀
